# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Description

This project performs sentiment analysis on a given text dataset using machine learning. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a given text as positive or negative.

## Dataset

The IMDB Movie Review Dataset can be downloaded from [https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/domnicalarrea/trabajo-corona). This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd repo`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Open the `SentimentAnalysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to train and test the sentiment analysis model.
3. To use the trained model to predict sentiment on new text data, run the `predict_sentiment.py` script with the desired text data file as an argument. For example, `python predict_sentiment.py data/new_reviews.txt`.
