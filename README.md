# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Description

This project performs sentiment analysis on a given text dataset using machine learning. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a given text as positive or negative.
The project includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the entire process of building and training the sentiment analysis model, as well as testing its accuracy. Additionally, a script is provided for loading and predicting sentiment on new text data.

## Dataset

The IMDB Movie Review Dataset can be downloaded from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/domnicalarrea/trabajo-corona/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/domnicalarrea/trabajo-corona). This dataset contains 41,157 tweets reviews from Twitter.
